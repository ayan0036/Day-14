Explanation of Update/Delete Methods in Mongoose: 



In Mongoose, the .findByIdAndUpdate() method is used to locate a document in the MongoDB collection by its unique _id and update its fields with the specified data. This method takes three main arguments: the ID of the document, the updated data object, and an optional configuration object. A common option is { new: true }, which ensures that the updated document is returned rather than the original. This method is particularly useful when you want to quickly update specific fields in a document without retrieving and saving it separately. 

The .findByIdAndDelete() method is used to delete a document by its _id. It searches for the document in the collection and removes it permanently if found. If the provided ID does not match any document, the method returns null. This method is commonly used in REST APIs to handle delete operations in a clean and efficient way. 

Together, these methods help developers manage data in MongoDB more effectively by providing simple, direct operations for modifying and removing records based on their unique identifiers.
